To do that, we fit the model to a subset of the data (the subset contains all responses to 44 out of the 48 stimulus classes, none to the other 4). When fitting the cross-validation models, we follow the same procedure we use when fitting all the data, but we need to use something else for evaluation: we get each cross-validation model's predictions for the 4 classes it *didn't* see, concatenating together these predictions for all 12 of them, then compare this against the full dataset (all voxels, all stimuli). We then create a dataframe containing this loss, as well as other identifying information, and save it at the specified path. We also save out the predictions and targets tensors. The arguments for this function are a bit strange because it's expressly meant to be called by a snakemake rule and not directly from a python interpreter (it gets called by the rules calc_cv_error and calc_simulated_cv_error) Parameters loss_files : list list of strings giving the paths to loss files for the cross-validation models. each one contains, among other things the specific test subset for this model, and there should be an associated model.pt file saved in the same folder. dataset_path : str The path to the first_level_analysis dataframe, saved as a csv, which contains the actual data our model was fit to predict wildcards : dict dictionary of wildcards, information used to identify this model . Automatically put together by snakemake outputs : list list containing two strings, the paths to save the loss dataframe (as a csv) and the predictions / targets tensors (as a pt) df_filter_string : str or None, optional a str specifying how to filter the voxels in the dataset. see the docstrings for sfp.model.FirstLevelDataset and sfp.model.construct_df_filter for more details.

As an example, imagine the following possible pyramid. At scale 2 (the highest resolution) there are 4 original images. At scale 1, images are averaged and concatenated into one image . Calling this function using S=0 will attempt to generate 1234 by calling this function again to get image 12, which will then call this function again to get image 1 and then image 2. Note that this function actually builds images in quadrants (top left and right, bottom left and right) rather than two sections as displayed above. Due to the nature of how this function works, it is possible to build a pyramid in parallel, since building the subpyramid under image 12 can be run independently of the building of subpyramid under 34."}

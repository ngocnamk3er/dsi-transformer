Normally the configuration is dumped starting\nwith the root logger, but any logger name can be given.\n\nEach line contains information for a single logger and it's appenders.\nA child logger is indented two spaces from it's parent logger. Each\nline contains the logger name, level, additivity, and trace settings.\nHere is a brief example.\n\n\n\nThe lines can be deciphered as follows.\n\n1) name       - the name of the logger\n\n2) level      - the logger level; if it is preceded by an\nasterisk then the level was explicitly set for that\nlogger (as opposed to being inherited from the parent\nlogger)\n\n3) additivity - a \"+A\" shows the logger is additive, and log events\nwill be passed up to the parent logger; \"-A\" shows\nthat the logger will *not* pass log events up to the\nparent logger\n\n4) tracing    - a \"+T\" shows that the logger will include caller\ntracing information in generated log events (this\nincludes filename and line number of the log\nmessage); \"-T\" shows that the logger does not include\ncaller tracing information in the log events\n\nIf a logger has appenders then they are listed, one per line,\nimmediately below the logger. Appender lines are pre-pended with a\nsingle dash.\n\n\n\nWe can see in this configuration dump that all the loggers will append\nto stdout via the Stdout appender configured in the root logger. All\nthe loggers are additive, and so their generated log events will be\npassed up to the root logger.\n\nThe exception in this configuration is LoggerD. Its additivity is set\nto false. It uses its own appender to send messages to stderr."}

Looks like there are no more\nstars to be had.\n\nWhile sitting on a nearby bench amidst some tiger lilies, you manage to decrypt some of the files you extracted from\nthe servers downstairs.\n\nAccording to these documents, Easter Bunny HQ isn't just this building - it's a collection of buildings in the nearby\narea. They're all connected by a local monorail, and there's another building not far from here. Unfortunately, being\nnight, the monorail is currently not operating.\n\nYou remotely connect to the monorail control systems and discover that the boot sequence expects a password. The\npassword-checking logic (your puzzle input) is easy to extract, but the code it uses is strange: it's assembunny code\ndesigned for the new computer you just assembled. You'll have to execute the code and get the password.\n\nThe assembunny code you've extracted operates on four registers (a, b, c, and d) that start at 0 and can hold any integer.\nHowever, it seems to make use of only a few instructions.\n\ncpy x y copies x (either an integer or the value of a register) into register y.\ninc x increases the value of register x by one.\ndec x decreases the value of register x by one.\njnz x y jumps to an instruction y away (positive means forward; negative means backward), but only if x is not zero.\n\nThe jnz instruction moves relative to itself: an offset of -1 would continue at the previous instruction, while an offset\nof 2 would skip over the next instruction.\n\nFor example.\n\ncpy 41 a\ninc a\ninc a\ndec a\njnz a 2\ndec a\n\nThe above code would set register a to 41, increase its value by 2, decrease its value by 1, and then skip the last dec a\n(because a is not zero, so the jnz a 2 skips it), leaving register a at 42. When you move past the last instruction, the\nprogram halts.\n\n\n\nPart Two\n\nAs you head down the fire escape to the monorail, you notice it didn't start; register c needs to be initialized to the\nposition of the ignition key.\n\n"}
